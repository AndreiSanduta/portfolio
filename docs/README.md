<br>
<br>
The website for a company that does interior Design is what Sanduta design aims to be. <br>
was developed with the goal of making this business name a solid reputation in Stockholm. <br>
When someone decides to renovate a room or another area, "Sanduta design" should always <br>
appear among the top search results on Google, for instance. Some of the most talented and <br>
knowledgeable architects and designers are employed by this website, and they are passionate <br>
about what they do. The joy on the faces of those who choose to use Sanduta Design's services <br>
is their highest reward.

## **Features:**

**The landing page** <br>
 has a picture with a modern, clean look that gives the user an idea of <br>
what to anticipate from this website. A lovely, peaceful sensation is maintained when <br>
exploring the pages thanks to the design, that is fairly simple and minimalist. <br>

## **Testing**

Coding Checks:

* When clicked, the "get a quotation" button did not bring up the form.

By placing the button within a "div" along with the form, I was able to remedy that.

* The submit button wasn't connected to the submit message.

I used "data-href" to fix that.

**User experience evaluation:**


* The main page is connected to the logo button. The landing page should always be <br>
reached after clicking the logo button. We may verify that it is functioning by clicking on it.

![](test1.png)

* When the mouse is over the text like in the figure below, the primary menu buttons should be <br>
underlined. The user may now anticipate which page they will click on next thanks to that functionality.

![](test2.png)

* Ask a quotation button has a sliding effect. The button slides slightly up and to the left and <br>
changes color from a brighter gradient to a darker gradient when the mouse is hovered over it. I've tested it, <br>
and I can confirm that the button changes color and moves as it should.

![](test3.png)

* Buttons in the footer, when the mouse hovers over the social media icons, they should be vanished. 

![](test4.png)

* The respective social networking sites, including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Pinterest, <br>
are connected to the symbols. As seen in the illustration below, clicking the icons should open <br>
the social network links in a new tab.

![](test5.png)

* Form:
When a user attempts to submit a form that is either incomplete or contains incorrect data, the <br>
form cannot be submitted, and notifications should be displayed to help the user understand what needs <br>
to be rectified before the form can be completed.
The picture shows that it's functioning as it should. The form cannot be submitted if <br>
the email field does not contain the "@" sign.

![](test6.png)

* All The fields must be filled out. If the fields are not filled out, the form cannot be <br>
submitted, and when the user tries to submit it, a notice asking them to <br>
"Please fill in this field" will appear.

![](test7.png)

* The project's start date is the same, as can be seen in the figure below. <br>
The submission fails if the user tries to submit without choosing the project starting date, <br>
and users receive a message that the starting date field has to be filled in.

![](test8.png)

* A confirmation message will appear when you've tested every field and clicked the submit button, <br>
if every field has the right data entered in it. We can certify that it is functioning properly after testing.

![](test9.png)

* As a last check to ensure that all the buttons are functional and appropriately connected, I verified that <br>
they all led to the appropriate sites by clicking each main menu button individually. I was able to validate <br>
that everything was up to date by doing this.

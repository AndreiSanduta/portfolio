    <td class="textabout">Sanduta Design started with a simple idea to offer people the most 
        pleasant environment possible within their own homes. It all started with the 
        idea that the founder of the project had after renovating his room with just a 
        bucket of paint and some old furniture. The end result was so good that he thought 
        the following: I would like more people to have the same feeling as me, to see the house 
        renovated with little money but with a spectacular end result. With that in mind, he started 
        the project "Sanduta Design" where the main philosophy of the company is to bring the best result
         with the existing means. Thinking about the environmental issue, especially all furniture and 
         decoration items that are possible to restore and reintegrate into the new decoration is a 
         priority for us.</h3>
